# Week 1 â€” Printing Patterns in Python

**Objective:**  
Get familiar with Python basics, variables, and loops by writing a simple program to print patterns.

**Task:**  
- Write a script that prints a specified number of stars in a single line.  
- Practice using loops and the `print()` function with formatting.

**Code Summary:**  
The script defines a variable `num_stars` (set to 15) and uses a `for` loop to print the stars with spaces in between.
