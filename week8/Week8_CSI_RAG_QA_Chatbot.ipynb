    "### What I Learned:\n",
    "- How to convert structured data into document-style text\n",
    "- How to build a FAISS index for fast retrieval\n",
    "- How to use transformer models for question answering\n",
    "- How to combine retrieval and generation for more intelligent responses\n",
    "\n",
    "I realized that the quality of generation improves a lot if the prompt includes good context. I enjoyed making this chatbot.\n",
