# Week 2 â€” Singly Linked List (OOP in Python)

**Objective:**  
Understand data structures and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by implementing a Singly Linked List in Python.

**Tasks:**  
- Define a `Node` class to represent each element (data + pointer to next).  
- Define a `LinkedList` class to manage the list.  
- Implement key operations:  
  - Add a node to the list  
  - Delete a node at a given position  
  - Display the list contents  

**Code Summary:**  
- A linked list is built using nodes connected by pointers.  
- The program allows inserting new nodes, deleting nodes at specific positions, and printing the current list.  
- Driver code demonstrates adding values (5, 10, 15, 20), deleting the 3rd node, and showing the updated list.
