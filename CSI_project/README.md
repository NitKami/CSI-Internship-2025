# Topic Modeling of Text Data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

## üìÇ Project Overview

This project implements a topic modeling pipeline to automatically identify and extract thematic topics from a corpus of text documents. The core technique used is **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm for discovering abstract topics in a collection of documents.

The primary goal was to process raw text data, build a robust LDA model, and visualize the resulting topics to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying themes within the dataset.

## üìö Key Concepts & Techniques

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, including:

* **Text Preprocessing:** Essential steps to clean and prepare text data for modeling, including:
    * Tokenization
    * Stopword Removal
    * Lemmatization
* **Vectorization:** Converting text documents into a numerical representation using methods like:
    * **Bag-of-Words (BoW):** Creating a document-term matrix where each document is represented by the frequency of its words.
    * **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Weighting words based on their importance to a document within a collection of documents.
* **Topic Modeling with LDA:** Applying the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to the vectorized data to discover a set of topics.
* **Model Evaluation:** Using the **Coherence Score (C_v)** to quantitatively measure the quality and interpretability of the topics generated by the model.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Using `pyLDAvis` to create an interactive visualization of the topics, showing their prevalence and the terms that define them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

* **Language:** `Python`
* **Core NLP & ML Libraries:** `Gensim`, `NLTK`, `Scikit-learn`
* **Data Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Visualization:** `pyLDAvis`, `Matplotlib`
* **Environment:** `Jupyter Notebook`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

The topic modeling pipeline was structured as follows:

1.  **Data Loading:** The text dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for initial inspection.
2.  **Text Preprocessing:** A series of cleaning steps were applied to each document to prepare it for modeling. This included converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation and stop words, and reducing words to their root form (lemmatization).
3.  **Corpus & Dictionary Creation:** A dictionary mapping each word to a unique ID was created from the preprocessed text. This dictionary was then used to build a Bag-of-Words corpus.
4.  **LDA Model Training:** The `Gensim` library was used to train an LDA model on the corpus. The model was configured to identify a specific number of topics.
5.  **Model Evaluation & Tuning:** The coherence score was calculated to evaluate the quality of the discovered topics. This step can be iterated upon by training models with different numbers of topics to find the optimal value that yields the most coherent results.
6.  **Topic Visualization:** The `pyLDAvis` library was used to generate an interactive visualization. This powerful tool helps in interpreting the model's output by showing:
    * The inter-topic distance on a 2D map.
    * The most relevant terms for each topic.
    * The overall term frequency in the corpus.

## üìä Visualizations

The primary output of this project is the interactive LDA visualization, which provides a rich, explorable view of the topic model.

## üí° Conclusion & Learnings

This project successfully demonstrates the application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover hidden topics within a text dataset. The process highlighted the critical importance of thorough text preprocessing for achieving meaningful results. Furthermore, the use of coherence scores provided a quantitative method for model evaluation, while `pyLDAvis` proved to be an invaluable tool for the qualitative interpretation of the topics. This end-to-end pipeline serves as a strong foundation for various text analysis applications, such as document categorization, content recommendation, and trend analysis.
