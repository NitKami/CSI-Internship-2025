## üìù Description

This week's assignment was focused on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a flight delay dataset. The objective was to uncover initial insights, understand the relationships between different variables, identify patterns, and check for anomalies like outliers and missing values.

The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, with the core libraries being Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

## üìö Key Concepts Learned

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The foundational process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
* **Data Manipulation with Pandas:** Creating and inspecting DataFrames, checking for null values, and generating descriptive statistics.
* **Data Visualization:** Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots:
    * **Histograms:** To understand the distribution of single variables like departure and arrival delays.
    * **Box Plots:** To identify outliers and compare distributions across different categories (e.g., delays by airline).
    * **Heatmaps:** To visualize the correlation matrix and quickly identify relationships between numeric variables.
    * **Pairplots:** To observe pairwise relationships across all numerical features in the dataset at once.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

* **Language:** `Python`
* **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`
* **Environment:** `Jupyter Notebook`

## üìä Analysis Steps & Visualizations

The EDA process followed several key steps:

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection
The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial checks confirmed the data types and the absence of missing values.


# Checking for missing values
df.isnull().sum()
2. Summary Statistics
Descriptive statistics were generated for both numerical and categorical columns to get a high-level overview of the data.

# Generate summary statistics for all columns
df.describe(include='all')
3. Distribution of Delays
Histograms were plotted to visualize the distribution of departure (DepDelay) and arrival (ArrDelay) times. This helped in understanding the frequency and spread of delays.

4. Outlier Analysis by Airline
Box plots were used to compare the delay performance across different airlines and to visually detect outliers in departure and arrival delays.

5. Correlation Analysis
A correlation heatmap was generated to quantify the linear relationship between the numerical variables in the dataset. This is crucial for understanding which variables move together.

# Correlation Heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.heatmap(df.select_dtypes(include=['number']).corr(), annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Between Numeric Variables')
plt.show()
Caption: Heatmap showing a strong positive correlation between DepDelay and ArrDelay, as well as Distance and AirTime.

üí° Key Insights
From this analysis, several key insights were derived:

Strong Correlation: There is a very strong positive correlation between DepDelay and ArrDelay, which is expected. Distance and AirTime are also highly correlated.

Airline Performance: The box plots revealed that delay patterns and the presence of outliers vary significantly from one airline to another.

Data Quality: The dataset was clean, with no missing values, allowing for a straightforward analysis.

Outliers: Outliers are present in the delay data, indicating some flights experience exceptionally long delays compared to the average.

This EDA provides a solid foundation for any subsequent machine learning modeling, such as predicting flight delays.****
