# Celebal Summer Internship (2025)

Welcome to the official repository for my work during the 8-week summer internship program at **Celebal Technologies**. This repository is a complete collection of all the weekly assignments, projects, and skills I developed throughout the program, referred to internally as the Celebal Summer Internship (CSI).

##  Internship Overview

This intensive internship provided a structured, hands-on journey through the fundamentals of Python programming, data analysis, machine learning, and model deployment. Each week introduced a new concept, building upon the last, culminating in a final project that integrated these skills to solve a real-world problem.

## ðŸ“‚ Main Project: Topic Modeling & RAG Chatbot

The primary project for this internship involved developing advanced NLP systems. It demonstrates an end-to-end understanding of processing complex text data and building intelligent applications.

* **Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** An unsupervised learning pipeline was built to automatically discover hidden thematic structures within a text corpus. This involved text preprocessing, vectorization (Bag-of-Words), training an LDA model with Gensim, and evaluating topic coherence. The results were visualized using the interactive `pyLDAvis` library.
* **RAG Question-Answering Chatbot:** A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system was created to answer questions based on a specific document. This project utilized local, open-source LLMs and embedding models, a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval, and LangChain to orchestrate the entire QA pipeline.

##  Weekly Breakdown

Here is a summary of the topics and skills covered each week. Click on a week to navigate to its detailed README and associated files.

* **[Week 1: Python Basics - Star Pattern Generation](./Week-01/)**
    * **Description:** An introduction to Python's fundamental concepts, focusing on control flow. The task was to use `for` loops and string manipulation to print a diamond star pattern.
    * **Skills:** `for` loops, `range()`, string manipulation.

* **[Week 2: Singly Linked List using Object-Oriented Programming](./Week-02/)**
    * **Description:** A foundational computer science exercise implementing the Singly Linked List data structure from scratch using OOP principles in Python.
    * **Skills:** Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, Node manipulation, Methods (`append`, `delete`).

* **[Week 3: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn](./Week-03/)**
    * **Description:** Explored Python's core visualization libraries. Created a variety of plots to analyze a sample sales dataset, comparing the strengths of both Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    * **Skills:** Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps, violin plots.

* **[Week 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Flight Delays](./Week-04/)**
    * **Description:** A comprehensive EDA was performed on a flight delay dataset. The goal was to inspect the data, find patterns, analyze distributions, and identify correlations.
    * **Skills:** Descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, outlier detection, correlation heatmaps.

* **[Week 5: House Price Prediction - Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering](./Week-05/)**
    * **Description:** Prepared the Ames Housing dataset for a machine learning model. This involved handling missing values, creating new features (`HouseAge`, `TotalSF`), and encoding categorical variables.
    * **Skills:** Missing value imputation, feature engineering, ordinal & one-hot encoding.

* **[Week 6: Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning](./Week-06/)**
    * **Description:** Trained and evaluated several classification models on the Wine dataset. Implemented techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best model parameters.
    * **Skills:** `train_test_split`, `StandardScaler`, `SVM`, `Random Forest`, `Logistic Regression`, model evaluation metrics.

* **[Week 7: Deploying a Machine Learning Model with Streamlit](./Week-07/)**
    * **Description:** Deployed a trained Iris flower classification model as an interactive web application. This project demonstrated the full lifecycle from training and saving a model to building a user-friendly UI for predictions.
    * **Skills:** Model serialization (`pickle`), web app development with `Streamlit`.

* **[Week 8: Final Project - RAG Chatbot Implementation](./Week-08/)**
    * **Description:** Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question-Answering system using LangChain, local LLMs (Llama 2), and a FAISS vector store.
    * **Skills:** `LangChain`, `RAG`, `LLMs`, `Vector Stores`, `Embeddings`.
